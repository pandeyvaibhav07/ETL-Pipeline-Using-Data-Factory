# ETL-Pipeline-Using-Data-Factory
Used the data analytics stack to extract, transform, and load the data using Data Factory.
Problem Statement:
As a Data Engineer, youâ€™ve been asked to access the services that can help with ETL of data in
the cloud data storage to enable analytics through Synapse. In this POC, we will be collecting
the data from SQL Database using ADF and the transformed data will be the source for
databricks to run complex transformations and once data is analysed using Databricks, it is
synced into synapse analytics data warehouse as historical dataset for enabling various
analytics.
